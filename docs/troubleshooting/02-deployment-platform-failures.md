## Railway Deployment Failure

### Problem
Railway service stuck in "INITIALIZING" state indefinitely.  

### Investigation
```
railway up
```
- Result: Upload successful, but service never starts
```
railway logs
```
- Result: "No deployments found"
```
railway status  
```
- Result: Service: None (despite project creation)


### Root Cause
- Missing `package-lock.json` file in backend directory.

---

## Render Deployment Failure

### Problem

- ERROR: npm ci --only=production failed  
npm error: The npm ci command can only install with an existing package-lock.json


### Investigation
- Build logs showed **npm ci** failure due to missing lockfile.

### Solution Implementation
**Generate Missing File**
```bash
cd backend
npm install   # Generates package-lock.json
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "add missing package-lock.json"
git push origin main
```

### Results

- ✅ Render: Immediate successful deployment
- ✅ Railway: Would now work (same root cause)
